Code used in Chevalier & Fransson (1992) ApJ 395, 540, but with a
major upgrade of especially the atomic data. The code is therefore written in Fortran 77.

This code was used to calculate the line luminosities for the Science
paper 'Ionizing radiation from a compact object in SN 1987A'. H or He
are not included in this version. Most of the atmic data is in the
direectory ATDAT. Input files for the cooling neutron star and pulsar
wind cases, called, pulin3.cnsneb and pulin3.pwnneb, are included. To
chose between these print csnneb (CNS) or pwnneb (PWN) for the first input
when running the program. The next is the number of shells, currently up to
350. The temperature limit is set at 100 K. For broken power laws use 
pulin3.pwnb1 (break at 4.1 keV) and pulin3.pwnbr2 (break at 1.25 keV), 
for O-Ne-C pulin3.o_ne_c and for the PWN with filling factor 1.0 pulin3.pwnfi1. 
All runs are listed in models.txt

The 500 strongest lines are found in strong_lines_xxx.txt
and the ionization and temperature structure in strucxxx, where xxx is
the model number (3 digits). These are set in the pulin3-files.
