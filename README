Code used in Chevalier & Fransson (1992) ApJ 395, 540, but with a
major upgrade of especially the atomic data. The code is therefore written in Fortran 77.

This code was used to calculate the line luminosities for the Science
paper 'Ionizing radiation from a compact object in SN 1987A'. H or He
are not included in this version. Most of the atmic data is in the
direectory ATDAT. Input files for the cooling neutron star and pulsar
wind cases, called, pulin3.nstneb and pulin3.pwnneb, are included. To
chose between these print nstneb or pwnneb for the first question when
running the program. The next is the number of shells, currently up to
350. The temperature limit is set at 100 K. Can be lowered to at least
50 K.

The 500 strongest lines are found in strong_lines_xxx.txt
and the ionization and temperature structure in strucxxx, where xxx is
the model number (3 digits). These are set in the pulin3-files.
